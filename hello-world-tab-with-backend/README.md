> Important: Please be advised that access tokens are stored in sessionStorage for you by default. This can make it possible for malicious code in your app (or code pasted into a console on your page) to access APIs at the same privilege level as your client application. Please ensure you only request the minimum necessary scopes from your client application, and perform any sensitive operations from server side code that your client has to authenticate with.
Microsoft Teams supports the ability to run web-based UI inside "custom tabs" that users can install either for just themselves (personal tabs) or within a team or group chat context.

Hello World Tab with Backend shows you how to build a tab app with an Azure Function as backend, how to get user login information with SSO and how to call Azure Function from frontend tab.

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), fully tested on NodeJS 14, 16
- An M365 account. If you do not have M365 account, apply one from [M365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)
- [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) or [TeamsFx CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli)

## What you will learn in this sample:

- How to use TeamsFx to build frontend hosting on Azure for your tab app.
- How to use TeamsFx to build backend hosting on Azure for your tab app.
- How to use MS graph client in TeamsFx to get access to M365 data.

## Try the Sample with Visual Studio Code Extension:
>Here are the instructions to run the sample in **Visual Studio Code**. You can also try to run the app using TeamsFx CLI tool, refer to [Try the Sample with TeamsFx CLI](cli.md)
1. Clone the repo to your local workspace or directly download the source code.
1. Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and install [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit).
1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
1. Start debugging the project by hitting the `F5` key in Visual Studio Code.

## Edit the manifest

You can find the Teams manifest in `templates/appPackage` folder. The templates contains:
* `manifest.template.json`: Manifest file for Teams app running locally and remotely.

Both file contains template arguments with `{...}` statements which will be replaced at build time. You may add any extra properties or permissions you require to this file. See the [schema reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema) for more.

## Deploy to Azure

Deploy your project to Azure by following these steps:

| From Visual Studio Code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | From TeamsFx CLI                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <ul><li>Open Teams Toolkit, and sign into Azure by clicking the `Sign in to Azure` under the `ACCOUNTS` section from sidebar.</li> <li>After you signed in, select a subscription under your account.</li><li>Open the Teams Toolkit and click `Provision in the cloud` from DEPLOYMENT section or open the command palette and select: `Teams: Provision in the cloud`.</li><li>Open the Teams Toolkit and click `Deploy to the cloud` or open the command palette and select: `Teams: Deploy to the cloud`.</li></ul> | <ul> <li>Run command `teamsfx account login azure`.</li> <li>Run command `teamsfx account set --subscription <your-subscription-id>`.</li> <li> Run command `teamsfx provision`.</li> <li>Run command: `teamsfx deploy`. </li></ul> |

> Note: Provisioning and deployment may incur charges to your Azure Subscription.

## Package

- From Visual Studio Code: open the command palette and select `Teams: Zip Teams metadata package`.
- Alternatively, from the command line run `teamsfx package` in the project directory.

## Publish to Teams

Once deployed, you may want to distribute your application to your organization's internal app store in Teams. Your app will be submitted for admin approval.

- From Visual Studio Code: open the Teams Toolkit and click `Publish to Teams` or open the command palette and select: `Teams: Publish to Teams`.
- From TeamsFx CLI: run command `teamsfx publish` in your project directory.

## Architecture

- The frontend is a react tab app hosted on [Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/).
- The Backend server is hosted on [Azure Function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/) for managing posts in the tab app.

### Code structure

- You can check app configuration and environment information in: [.fx](.fx)
- You will find frontend code in: [tabs/src/components](tabs/src/components)
- You will find backend code in: [api/getUserProfile](api/getUserProfile)
