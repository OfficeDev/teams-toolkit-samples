# Getting Started with Stocks Update Notification Bot

Bots can be used to deliver pro-active messages into different Microsoft Teams contexts, such as a personal bot chat, one to one or group chat, or a channel conversation.

The Stocks Update Notification bot shows you how to request data on a pretermined schedule from a public API using API Key authentication and render that data using an Adaptive Card in different Microsoft Teams contexts.

## Prerequisite to use this sample
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 16, 18
- A Microsoft 365 account. If you do not have Microsoft 365 account, apply one from [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)

## Minimal path to awesome
### Run the app locally
1. Clone the repo to your local workspace or directly download the source code.
1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
1. Update local environment variables in `env/.env.local` and `env/.env.local.user`

	 For the HTTP request to the public API to be succesful, the following environment variables need to be configured in the `env/.env.local` and `env/.env.local.user` files.

	 ```sh
	 # env/.env.local
	 TEAMSFX_API_ALPHAVANTAGE_ENDPOINT=https://www.alphavantage.co
	 # env/.env.local.user for secret
	 TEAMSFX_API_ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY=demo
	 ```
   > The demo key will not update values, you can [sign up for a free key](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key) for the Alpha Vantage service and update the `TEAMSFX_API_ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY` setting with your own key.
1. Start debugging the project by hitting the `F5` key in Visual Studio Code.

### Deploy the app to Azure
1. Open Teams Toolkit, and sign into Azure by clicking the `Sign in to Azure` under the `ACCOUNTS` section from sidebar.
1. Open the Teams Toolkit and click `Provision` from LIFECYCLE section or open the command palette and select: `Teams: Provision`.
1. Open the Teams Toolkit and Click `Deploy` or open the command palette and select: `Teams: Deploy`.
> Note: Provisioning and deployment may incur charges to your Azure Subscription.

### Preview the app in Teams
1. Once deployment is completed, you can preview the app running in Azure. In Visual Studio Code, open `Run and Debug` and select `Launch Remote (Edge)` or `Launch Remote (Chrome)` in the dropdown list and Press `F5` or green arrow button to open a browser.
