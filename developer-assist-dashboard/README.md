# Getting Started with Developer Assist Dashboard

Microsoft Teams supports the ability to run web-based UI inside "custom tabs" that users can install either for just themselves (personal tabs) or within a team or group chat context.

Developer Assist Dashboard shows you how to build a tab with Azure DevOps work items, GitHub issues and Planner tasks to accelerate developer team collaboration and productivity. Developer Assist Dashboard is capable of working on Microsoft Teams, Outlook Web and Microsoft 365 app.

> Note: This sample will only provision [single tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/single-and-multi-tenant-apps#who-can-sign-in-to-your-app) Azure Active Directory app. For multi-tenant support, please refer to this [wiki](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-multi-tenant).

## This sample illustrates

- How to use TeamsFx to embed a canvas containing multiple cards that provide an overview of data or content in your tab app.
- How to use TeamsFx to build frontend hosting on Azure for your tab app.
- How to use TeamsFx to build backend hosting on Azure for your tab app.
- How to use DevOps, GitHub, and Microsoft Graph APIs in TeamsFx to get access to variety of data.

## Prerequisite to use this sample

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 16, 18
- A Microsoft 365 tenant in which you have permission to upload Teams apps. You can get a free Microsoft 365 developer tenant by joining the [M365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)
- [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [TeamsFx CLI](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit-cli)

## Minimal path to awesome
