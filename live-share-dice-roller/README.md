## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 16, 18
- An M365 account. If you do not have M365 account, apply one from [M365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)
- [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [TeamsFx CLI](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit-cli)

## Run the app locally

- In Visual Studio Code: Start debugging the project by hitting the `F5` key in your keyboard. 
  - Alternatively open the `Run and Debug Activity` panel(Ctrl+Shift+D) in Visual Studio Code and click the `Run and Debug` green arrow button.
- The Teams web client will launch in your browser, click the small arrow sit aside the `Add` button and select `Add to a meeting`, then select the meeting you just created. 
- Click `Set up a tab` in the next step, it will take you to the meeting configuration page.

- Open Teams Toolkit in Visual Studio Code, and sign in your Azure account by clicking the `Sign in to Azure` in the `ACCOUNTS` section from sidebar.
- After you signed in, select a subscription under your account. The Teams Toolkit will use this subscription to provision Azure resources to host you app.
- Open the Teams Toolkit and click `Provision` in the `LIFECYLE` section.
  - Alternatively open the command palette(Ctrl+Shift+P) and type: `Teams: Provision` command.
- Open the Teams Toolkit and click `Deploy` in the `LIFECYLE` section.
