# Overview of Collect Form Input and Process Data template

A Message Extension allows users to interact with your web service while composing messages in the Microsoft Teams client. Users can search or initiate actions in an external system from compose message area, the command box, or directly from a message.

This app template implements action command that allows you to present your users with a modal pop-up called a task module in Teams. The task module collects or displays information, processes the interaction, and sends the information back to Teams.

## Get started with the template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run the template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 18, 20, 22
> - [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli)

> For local debugging using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI, you need to do some extra steps described in [Set up your Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI for local debugging](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli-debugging).

1. First, select the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
2. Press F5 to start debugging which launches your app in Microsoft 365 Agents playground using a web browser.
3. To trigger the action command, you can click the `+` under compose message area and select `Action Command`.

**Congratulations**! You are running an application that can share information in rich format by creating an Adaptive Card in Microsoft 365 Agents playground.

| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `.vscode/`    | VSCode files for debugging                   |
| `appPackage/` | Templates for the Teams application manifest |
| `env/`        | Environment files                            |
| `infra/`      | Templates for provisioning Azure resources   |
| `src/`        | The source code for the action application   |

The following files can be customized and demonstrate an example implementation to get you started.

| File               | Contents                                                                                 |

| `src/actionApp.js` | Handles the business logic for this app template to collect form input and process data. |
| `src/index.js`     | `index.js` is used to setup and configure the Message Extension.                         |

The following are Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit specific project files. You can [visit a complete guide on Github](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/wiki/Teams-Toolkit-Visual-Studio-Code-v5-Guide#overview) to understand how Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit works.

| File                 | Contents                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `teamsapp.yml`       | This is the main Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit project file. The project file defines two primary things: Properties and configuration Stage definitions. |
| `teamsapp.local.yml` | This overrides `teamsapp.yml` with actions that enable local execution and debugging.                                                     |
| `teamsapp.testtool.yml`| This overrides `teamsapp.yml` with actions that enable local execution and debugging in Microsoft 365 Agents playground.                            |
