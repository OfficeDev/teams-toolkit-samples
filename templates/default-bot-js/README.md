# Overview of the Basic Bot template

Examples of Microsoft Teams bots in everyday use include:

- Bots that notify about build failures.
- Bots that provide information about the weather or bus schedules.
- Bots that provide travel information.

A bot interaction can be a quick question and answer, or it can be a complex conversation. Being a cloud application, a bot can provide valuable and secure access to cloud services and corporate resources.

## Get started with the Basic Bot template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run the Basic Bot template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 18, 20, 22
> - [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli)

> For local debugging using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI, you need to do some extra steps described in [Set up your Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI for local debugging](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli-debugging).

1. First, select the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
2. Press F5 to start debugging which launches your app in Microsoft 365 Agents playground using a web browser. Select `Debug in Microsoft 365 Agents playground`.
3. The browser will pop up to open Microsoft 365 Agents playground.
4. You will receive a welcome message from the bot, and you can send anything to the bot to get an echoed response.

**Congratulations**! You are running an application that can now interact with users in Microsoft 365 Agents playground:
