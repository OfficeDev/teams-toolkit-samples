## Minimal path to awesome

### Deploy the app

>Here are the instructions to run the sample in **Visual Studio Code**. You can also try to run the app using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI tool, refer to [Try sample with Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI](cli.md)

1. Clone the repo to your local workspace or directly download the source code.
1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code, click `Provision` in LIFECYCLE panel of Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit extension or open the command palette and select `Microsoft 365 Agents: Provision`. This step will create an app in Teams App Studio.
1. Go back to Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit extension, click `Deploy` in LIFECYCLE panel or open the command palette and select `Microsoft 365 Agents: Deploy`.
    > This step will build a SharePoint package (*.sppkg) under `sharepoint/solution` folder. The Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit will automatically upload and deploy it to your tenant App Catalog site. Only tenant App Catalog site admin has permission to do it. If you are not the admin, you can create your test tenant following [Setup your Microsoft 365 tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-developer-tenant).
1. Go to your SharePoint Admin center. In the left-hand navigation, select `Advanced` and then `API Access`. You should see pending requests for each of the permissions requested in src\config\package-solution.json file. Select and approve each permission.

### Launch the app in Teams

1. Once deployment is completed, you can preview the app. In Visual Studio Code, select target environment and click `Preview App` in ENVIRONMENT panel to open a browser.
